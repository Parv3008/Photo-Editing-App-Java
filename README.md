# Photo-Editing-App-Java

Concept:-<br>

User Interface (UI) Design:<br>
Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for your app is essential. You'll need to create a GUI <br>
that allows users to easily import, edit, and save photos.<br>

File Handling:<br>
Java's file handling mechanisms to open and save images. Concepts like file input/output (I/O) and <br>
the use of file choosers are essential.<br>

Event Handling: <br>
Implement event handling for buttons and user interactions. Understanding event-driven <br>
programming is crucial for responding to user actions.<br>

Error Handling: <br>
To provide a robust user experience, handle potential errors gracefully. This includes error messages <br>
for invalid image formats, errors during file operations, and more.<br>

Import and Export:<br>
This app should support importing images from various sources like the device's gallery, camera, or<br>
cloud storage. It should also allow users to save their edited photos in different formats (e.g., JPEG,<br> 
PNG).<br>

Filters and Effects:<br>
Implementing filters and effects is a significant part of a photo editor. You'll need to understand <br>
concepts like convolution, color adjustments, and blending modes to create various artistic effects.<br>

Undo/Redo Functionality:<br>
Provide the ability for users to undo and redo their editing actions. This involves managing a stack of <br>
image states.<br>

Layers:<br>
To support advanced editing features, you might want to implement a layer system similar to what <br>
you'd find in professional image editing software. Layers enable non-destructive editing and <br>
composition.<br>

User Input Handling:<br>
Implement touch or mouse input handling for interactions like panning, zooming, and selecting areas <br>
of the image.<br>

File I/O:<br>
You'll need to understand how to read and write image files in various formats using Java, possibly <br>
with libraries like ImageIO.<br>

Java Swing Components We Will Use In This Project:<br>
- JFrame.<br>
- JPanel.<br>
- JButton.<br>
- JLabel.<br>
- JMenu.<br>
- JMenuBar.<br>
- JMenuItem.<br>

What We Will Use To Build This Project ? :<br>
• Java Programming Language.<br>
• NetBeans Editor.<br>
• Images.<br>

What We Will Do In This Project ? :<br>
• Open an Image: Click the 'Open' button to select an image file (supported formats: JPG, <br>
PNG). Invalid files prompt error messages.<br>
• Apply Filters: Choose from the available filters (Grayscale, Invert, Sepia, Blur, Edge Detection) <br>
and click the corresponding button to apply the filter to the loaded image.<br>
• Reset: Click the 'Reset' button to revert the edited image back to its original state.<br>
• Save Edited Image: Click the 'Save' button to save the edited image after applying desired<br> 
filters<br>
